The geographic and seasonal distribution of mosquitoes depends on many factors, including climate, weather, land cover, and pest control efforts. This application explores two main determinants of where and when mosquitoes may breed: surface water and daily air temperature. Standing surface water provides the habitat for breeding, while optimal air temperature provides the conditions for breeding and survival. Therefore, an increased amount of standing water on the landscape and increased number of days within an optimal air temperature range may increase local mosquito populations."),

When outdoors, wearing long-sleeve shirts and pants, as well as insect repellent, reduces the risk of being bitten. This is especially true during times of heightened mosquito activity, such as dawn and dusk, or near locations where mosquitoes likely breed. Regularly emptying water-holding containers and installing secure screens on windows and doors also helps control mosquito numbers both outside and inside your home."),
